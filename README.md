# KubeShield: Secure EKS Cluster Deployment

KubeShield is a Terraform- and Helm-based project that deploys a **secure AWS EKS cluster**. It automates the provisioning of Kubernetes resources, deploys **containerized Flask APIs**, enforces **RBAC policies**, integrates **Prometheus monitoring**, and performs automated cluster health checks to ensure resilience and reliability.

## Overview
KubeShield provides a complete **secure EKS cluster deployment workflow**. It combines Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Helm for Kubernetes application deployment, and Python scripts for health checks and monitoring. This project demonstrates best practices in cloud-native, containerized application deployment under strict security policies.
